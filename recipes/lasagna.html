    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 thick slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 Â½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 pounds Italian sausage links</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce: Brown bacon and onion in a large pan over medium heat until bacon is crisp and onion is translucent, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, fennel seed, and oregano. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until thick, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Cook the sausage: When the sauce is almost ready, brown sausage links in a large skillet. Drain on paper towels and cut into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Make the lasagna: Mix ricotta cheese, milk, eggs, parsley, and oregano together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Layer with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the sausage pieces, 2 cups mozzarella, 4 slices provolone, and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat layers once more, then top with remaining noodles. Spread remaining sauce over noodles and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
