    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken wings prepared Buffalo-style that taste absolutely wonderful!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 small chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®), or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
